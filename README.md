## Overview

The `frontend` repository is designed to provide a clean and responsive user interface for the project. It focuses on modern design practices and usability. Whether you're working with static HTML pages or integrating a dynamic JavaScript framework/library, this repository serves as your starting point for building high-quality user experiences.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
- **Modular Structure:** Organized folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, etc.
- **Clean UI:** A minimalist and user-friendly interface.
- **Framework Support:** Easily integrate with popular JavaScript frameworks/libraries if needed (e.g., React, Vue, or Angular).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (if using any Node-based tooling, build processes, or package managers)
- A modern web browser for testing and running the frontend

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/immo7932/frontend.git
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies (Optional):**  
   If the project uses a package manager (like npm or yarn), install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run a local development server (Optional):**  
   If you are using a build tool or development server, start it with:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   or

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   Then navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or the respective port mentioned in your terminal.

## Usage

The frontend code is organized to separate concerns clearly:
- **HTML:** Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling, including responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript:** Functionality for interacting with the UI and handling dynamic content.

You can modify the code and styles as needed. When building for production, ensure that you follow your project's build process to optimize assets (minifying CSS/JS, compressing images, etc.).

## Project Structure

A typical project structure might look like this:

```plaintext
frontend/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── css/              # Stylesheets
│   └── styles.css
├── js/               # JavaScript files
│   └── app.js
├── assets/           # Images, fonts, and other assets
├── package.json      # (Optional) Node project file for build tools/dependencies
└── README.md         # Documentation
```

Feel free to rearrange the structure to suit your development workflow.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy, follow these steps:

1. **Build the project (if applicable):**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   or

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

2. **Deploy the built files to your hosting provider:**  
   You can use any hosting solution such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your own web server.

3. **Configure domain and HTTPS (if required):**  
   Ensure your site is accessible over the internet with proper security settings.
